### Feb 2021

## Non-technical description of the project
This program will provide psychological solutions based on the user's situdation using sound.
Users simply selecet the catrgory that suits them and then select and listen to the sound they want.


## A technical overview of the project
Technically, I am planning to build the app using Android Studio. Kotlin will be used as a programming language, and the app uses Youtube's videos and sounds, so a device must be connected to the network
It will be a simple program. Without complicated manipulation, useres will be able to select and listen to sounds based on their individual cricumstances.

In the case of websites, if there is no restriction, it will be developed easily using wordpress


## What technical or non-technical information will you have to learn? 
In terms of technology, Kotlin will be a new challenge for me because I have been using Java mainly. However, Java and Kotlin are not considered to have much difficulty because they are compatible with each other.
Building an app is also a process that I must learn because I am not familiar with the production of applications.

On the non-technical side, I need to investigate what sounds people hear to reach a state of mental stability and comfort. For example, what sounds are usually included in "white noise" and what sounds are helpful for sleep


## A detailed list of technical tasks that have to be undertaken, together with an estimated timeline
A rough plan
Until March 21 - Information gathering and web creation

Else - app development
